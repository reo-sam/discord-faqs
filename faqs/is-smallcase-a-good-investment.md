# Is smallcase a good investment?

There are two parts to investing via smallcase:

- The tooling, around managing a watchlist of stocks, executing transactions at portfolio level rather at scrip level
- The selection process, which makes a stock portfolio, based on some parameters

No doubt, the usability of smallcase as a tool to manage a stock portfolio is quite good.

If you already have a plan to invest in a stock portfolio, you can create that watchlist and place orders using smallcase.

The second aspect, requires smallcase have a proven track record and people responsible for maintaining that particular portfolio have pedigree of stock selection.

These are few things to note:

- Depending on the churn there can be significant tax drag for you since you will be buying and selling units regularly. Smallcase is known to rebalance their portfolios every 90 days.

- Lack of proven track record that can be independently verified.

  AMCs are legally required to publish their daily NAVs, and their portfolios every month. Which means an AMC can't give you random numbers, they are forced to keep everything in the public's eye. This is not true for smallcases.

- Smallcase loves selling "Backtested Models". 

  Backtesting needs to be free from various biases, such as, look-ahead bias. Strategy derived from a backtest, would always show great results when simulated over the same time period.

- There are also some concerns around smallcase not being upfront with their numbers. They include backtested portfolio in computing returns of the smallcase, which is not at all how any asset management services report their returns.

Finally, keep in mind that past returns are not indicative of future returns; and asset returns can be very different from portfolio returns.

**TL;DR: use the product if you like it; but not because you think their advice alone would make you great returns.**
